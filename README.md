# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Big Data Tools

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the big data and integration tools to build a scalable and real-time fraud detection pipeline for credit card transactions.
It utilizes distributed data storage - HDFS, batch processing tools - Hive, Pig, real-time data streaming - Kafka, and machine learning to detect fraudulent behavior in credit card usage.

The goal is to simulate a real-world financial fraud detection system that can analyze massive transaction volumes and raise alerts in real time.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** from Kaggle:

- Source: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description**: The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with 284,807 transactions and 492 labeled frauds.
- For size and convenience, the dataset is included in compressed format:  `data/creditcard.csv.zip`
- Before using the data, unzip it:
- ```bash
unzip data/creditcard.csv.zip
 Second dataset
- Sourse: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023)
- Due to file size, this dataset is not stored directly in the repo.
